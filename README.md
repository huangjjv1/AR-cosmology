# AR Cosmology Project Review
Xcode: Version 11.3 (11C29)  
Imported packages: UIKit(2019/11); SceneKit(2019/11); ARKit(2019/11)  
  
Project Brief Description:  
This project aims to visualize a galaxy formation simulation model by using the given SPH particles. Then import these pre simulated model into a designed app, which will enable users to view the model in AR technology by the App. Specifically, the app will recognize a nebula map hanging on a wall with an anchor point. The procedure will firstly recognize the anchor point as an axis starting point. The initial interface of the app will show the real-time picture that the device camera is pointing to. By changing the different direction values of device. When obtained value meet the preset galaxy, more detailed information will be popped out in 3D model and show the formation information in 3D based on AGN feedback, mass stars, which define the structure of the universe model.
